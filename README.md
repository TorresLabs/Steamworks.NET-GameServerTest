Steamworks.NET-GameServerTest
=======

This is a sample project for [Steamworks.NET](//github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) it is intended to show functionality, act as documentation and to test the functionality of Steamworks.NET.

This project is based heavily upon the Official C++ SteamworksExample application SpaceWar. It is incomplete as there is no data passing.
It is recommended to follow along with SpaceWarServer.cpp/h found in the official Steamworks SDK.

Steam must be running for the project to work out of the box. To run a dedicated server without Steam running you must copy steamclient.dll/tier0_s.dll/vstdlib_s.dll next to your steam_api.dll.


This sample is licensed under the Public Domain (where acceptable.) Please view [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for more details.

This project was built with Unity 5.2.0. As such it is only expected to build and run without issue on Unity 5.2.0 or later.
